  p We'll be getting married at the beautiful #{link_to("Maroupi", "http://www.maroupiweddingvenue.co.za/")} venue, just outside of Umhlali.
  p There is parking on site with security but we will be arranging taxis/minibuses to central pick up and drop off points for those guests who would prefer not to drive. 
    Please let us know if you would like to opt in for lifts and where you are staying.
  p Regrettably, due to numbers, partners are by invitation only and we love your kids but thought you might like the night off so Adults only please!
